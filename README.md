# Practise-English-crew
Hi! I'm creating an English-speaking group on Google Meet, starting from 10 July. There’s no teacher—it’s a peer-learning space with regular speaking activities like topic discussion, Q&amp;A, role play, storytelling, etc. If you’re interested in speaking and improving your English, fill out this form. Let’s help each other grow!
